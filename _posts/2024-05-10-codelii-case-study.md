Codelii builds fast, beautiful websites for B2B brands that actually convert. Clean UX, sharp branding, and performance baked in.

But no matter how good their portfolio looked — getting consistent sales calls was a grind.

They weren’t the problem. Their outbound was.

That’s when they partnered with us at 1SecondLeads.

We didn’t just generate leads.  
We installed a 3-phase outbound system, laser-targeted to trigger intent and book real buyers.

## 🔍 Phase 1 – Precise Prospecting with Apollo

We built the base list with Apollo — but didn’t stop at surface-level filters.

Instead, we targeted **companies stuck in growth bottlenecks** like:

- Running outdated CMS builds (WordPress 4.9? Yikes.)
    
- Using drag-and-drop builders like Wix/Squarespace but scaling fast
    
- Ranking low for basic branded keywords (SEO neglect)
    
- Websites built pre-2017 — slow, clunky, not mobile-ready
    
- Using tech like Hotjar/Mixpanel (signal = they care about UX/CRO)
    

We looked for friction. Gaps. Behaviors that screamed:  
_“We need help but haven’t solved it yet.”_

## 🧠 Phase 2 – Deep Enrichment with Clay

Once the list was built, we ran it through a Clay.com enrichment waterfall to turn raw leads into _hyper-relevant_ outreach.

Each company was enriched with:

- **BuiltWith stack** → identified outdated platforms or WordPress sites with legacy plugins/themes
    
- **PageSpeed scores** → flagged low mobile scores (esp. LCP above 3s)
    
- **LinkedIn scraping** → captured lead roles, content they post, company culture
    
- **Website scraping** → picked up missing SSL, vague CTAs, non-responsive design
    
- **SEMrush checks** → found poor organic rankings = no inbound pipeline
    
- **GPT prompts** → auto-generated personalized snippets tied to their tech stack & issues
    

Then came the message:

> “Noticed [Site] is running on Elementor 3.3 and scoring 41 on mobile speed.  
> That combo kills conversions.  
> If you’re open to chatting, we just migrated 3 similar builds last month — all broke 90+ scores.”

We didn’t pitch “websites.”  
We pitched **urgent fixes** tied to **growth** — using language that hits.

## 📞 Phase 3 – Lukewarm Calling = Show-Up Engine

We didn’t wait for leads to book.

The second someone replied — whether asking for pricing, requesting more info, or just sitting on the fence — we picked up the phone.

Not to push. To guide:

> “Saw you were curious about our WordPress rebuild offer. Just hopped on to walk you through how we migrated three brands last quarter and what kind of speed bumps they hit.”

We also **called every lead the day before** their booked call to ensure clarity, prep, and commitment.

This gave us:

- **Book-to-meeting rate over 78%**
    
- **No-show rate under 10%**
    
- Prospects came in _warmed up_, _qualified_, and ready to buy

## 🚀 Results (First 2 Months)

While the partnership lasted 8 months, these are the numbers from the **initial 2-month sprint** — the typical testing phase for most clients:

- **7,000 leads engaged across all channels**
    
- **24 meetings booked**
    
- **21 meetings showed up** (at an 86% show-up rate)
    
- **4 deals closed** 

All booked directly from cold outreach.  
No ads. No referrals. Just outbound done right.

## Client Testimonial (for Codelii):

> "Before partnering with 1SecondLeads, our lead flow was too dependent on referrals. Their systematic and data-driven outbound strategy, especially using tools like Clay to identify companies with real technical needs for our services, has been transformative. We now have a predictable stream of qualified sales meetings, allowing us to grow Codelii more strategically than ever before." - CEO, Codelii
