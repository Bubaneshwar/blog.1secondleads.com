**Client:** Codelii – Custom Web Design & Development Agency ([codelii.com](https://codelii.com/))

**Timeline:** 6-Month Engagement

**Objective:** To significantly increase Codelii's pipeline of qualified leads for their web design, web development, and e-commerce solutions by targeting businesses with clear indicators of needing a new or improved digital presence.

### The Challenge: Breaking Through the Noise & Finding Scalable Growth

Codelii, a highly capable web development agency with a strong portfolio, relied primarily on referrals and inbound inquiries. While maintainable, this approach was inconsistent for their lead flow and limited their ability to proactively target specific high-value client segments. They needed a scalable, predictable outbound system to:

1.  Identify businesses actively demonstrating a need for website modernization or performance improvement.
2.  Reach key decision-makers within these organizations.
3.  Book qualified sales appointments for the Codelii team.

### Our Solution: A Data-Driven, Multi-Channel Outbound Strategy

We implemented a comprehensive outbound strategy leveraging advanced targeting, deep enrichment, and personalized multi-channel outreach.

**Phase 1: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Definition & Granular Targeting**

We identified several ICP segments likely to benefit most from Codelii's expertise:

*   **ICP 1: Companies with Outdated/Underperforming Websites:** Businesses whose current websites showed clear signs of needing a technical or aesthetic refresh.
*   **ICP 2: Growing B2B Service & SaaS Companies:** Businesses likely needing a more professional and scalable web presence to support their growth.
*   **ICP 3: E-commerce Businesses Needing Enhancement:** Online stores on platforms Codelii could optimize or those showing poor performance metrics.

**Targeting with Apollo.io (Initial List Generation):**

We built several core lists in Apollo, focusing on:

*   **For ICP 1 & 2 (Outdated/Underperforming & B2B/SaaS):**
    *   **Industries:** Professional Services (e.g., Consulting, Financial Services, Legal), Manufacturing, Software (B2B SaaS), Healthcare (private clinics, non-hospital services).
    *   **Employee Count:** 20-250.
    *   **Location:** Codelii's primary service markets (e.g., North America, UK).
    *   **Keywords (Company Description):** "consulting services," "manufacturing solutions," "B2B software," "patient services."...
    *   **Technologies (Exclusion):** Actively excluding companies *recently* identified as using very modern tech stacks that Codelii might not specialize in replacing (unless the angle is different).
    *   **Job Titles (People):** CEO, Founder, Owner, VP Marketing, Director of Marketing, Head of Marketing, Marketing Manager, VP Sales, Director of Sales, Head of Digital, Digital Marketing Manager, Operations Director/Manager.

*   **For ICP 3 (E-commerce):**
    *   **Industries:** Retail, Consumer Goods, Fashion, Electronics...
    *   **Keywords:** "e-commerce," "online store," "retail brand. ..."
    *   **Technologies (Positive & Negative):**
        *   *Positive:* Using Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento.
        *   *Opportunity for migration:* Wix Stores, Squarespace Commerce.
    *   **Employee Count:** 10-150.
    *   **Job Titles (People):** Same as above, plus "E-commerce Manager," "Head of E-commerce."

**Phase 2: Deep Enrichment & Signal Identification with Clay.com**

This is where we transformed raw lists into highly qualified, actionable leads for Codelii. Each lead from Apollo was processed through a Clay table with the following enrichment waterfall:

1.  **Data Validation & Cleaning:** Standardize names, company names.
2.  **Find Verified Emails & LinkedIn Profiles:** Using a cascade of providers (e.g., Hunter.io, Dropcontact, Prospeo) within Clay.
3.  **Scrape LinkedIn Company Page:** Extract "About Us," recent posts, company size, industry.
4.  **Scrape Lead's LinkedIn Profile:** Extract headline, "About" section, recent activity.
5.  **BuiltWith API Integration:**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify current website technology stack.
    *   **Signal for Codelii (Reason to Reach Out):**
        *   "Prospects using **outdated CMS versions** (e.g., older WordPress, Drupal) face significant **security vulnerabilities and often suffer from slower performance**, directly impacting user trust and conversion rates. Codelii can migrate them to modern, secure versions or entirely new platforms, enhancing both safety and speed."
        *   "Identifying businesses on **basic platforms like Wix or Squarespace that are hitting growth limitations** presents an opportunity for Codelii to offer a transition to more **scalable, custom solutions like WordPress or custom PHP**, unlocking greater functionality, design flexibility, and SEO potential critical for growing companies."
        *   "When a prospect uses a **technology Codelii excels at** (e.g., Shopify, specific WordPress builders), it’s a direct signal to offer **specialized optimization or advanced feature development services**, leading to demonstrably improved performance and ROI for the client's existing platform."
6.  **Google PageSpeed Insights API Integration:**
    *   **Purpose:** Assess current website performance.
    *   **Signal for Codelii (Reason to Reach Out):**
        *   "A prospect's website with a **low Google PageSpeed score** (e.g., mobile performance below 50, LCP over 2.5-4 seconds) directly translates to **poor user experience, higher bounce rates, and negatively impacts SEO rankings**. Codelii's development expertise addresses these core performance issues, leading to better engagement, higher rankings, and ultimately, more conversions."
        *   "Specific PageSpeed recommendations like **'reduce unused CSS' or 'serve images in next-gen formats' are clear technical debt indicators** that degrade user experience. Codelii can action these specific technical fixes, resulting in immediate and measurable site speed improvements that enhance the prospect's bottom line."
7.  **SEMRush API Integration (or similar like Ahrefs):**
    *   **Purpose:** Understand organic visibility and keyword footprint.
    *   **Signal for Codelii (Reason to Reach Out):**
        *   "**Low organic search traffic or ranking for very few relevant keywords** (identified via SEMrush) signifies a major missed opportunity for consistent, cost-effective lead generation. Codelii's approach to web development, which integrates SEO best practices from the ground up, can significantly **improve a prospect's search visibility and attract a steady stream of qualified inbound leads**."
8.  **Scrape Website Homepage & Key Service Pages (using Clay's browser):**
    *   **Purpose:** Look for specific language, value propositions, lack of clear CTAs, outdated design cues, missing SSL, non-mobile-friendliness.
    *   **Signal for Codelii (Reason to Reach Out):**
        *   "**Outdated design aesthetics** (e.g., styles clearly from pre-2015), **poor mobile responsiveness, missing SSL certificates, or unclear calls-to-action** on a prospect's website create immediate **credibility issues and lead to lost revenue and customer trust**. Codelii's redesign services directly address these visual and functional shortcomings, resulting in a more trustworthy, professional, and conversion-optimized online presence."
        *   "Websites with **copy that lists features rather than articulating clear client benefits and solutions** often fail to connect with their target audience or differentiate from competitors. Codelii can guide a **content and design refresh that clearly communicates unique value**, improving audience engagement and the quality of leads generated."
9.  **OpenAI (GPT) Integration for Custom Snippet Generation:**
    *   Based on all the above enrichments, we used OpenAI prompts in Clay to:
        *   Generate personalized opening lines: e.g., *"Noticed [Prospect Company]'s site is built on [Older CMS from BuiltWith] and our checks show it's scoring [X on PageSpeed Mobile]. This often means there's a significant opportunity to enhance user experience and conversions, a core strength of Codelii."*
        *   Identify the most relevant Codelii service.
        *   Suggest a pain point.

**Phase 3: Multi-Channel Outreach Execution (Email & LinkedIn)**

Using the enriched data and personalized snippets from Clay, we launched sequences via Instantly.ai.

**Email Sequence Example:**

*   **Subject Lines (A/B Tested):**
    *   A: Idea for [Prospect Company Name]'s website performance & conversions
