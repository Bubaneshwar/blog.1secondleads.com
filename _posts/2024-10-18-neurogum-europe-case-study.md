*Initial Neuro Europe Website Insights (of May till November 2024):*
*   **Product:** Neuro Gum & Mints (functional chewing gum and mints with natural caffeine, L-theanine, B-vitamins).
*   **Core Benefits:** "Energy, Clarity, Focus," "Calm & Centered Energy," "Clean Ingredients," "Sugar-Free, Aspartame-Free, Vegan, Gluten-Free."
*   **Target Audience:** Health-conscious individuals, students, professionals, athletes, gamers, creatives – anyone seeking a mental edge or clean energy boost.
*   **EU Focus:** Availability within Europe, shipping from EU, prices in Euros. This is key for influencer location targeting. This campaign was specifically made for the European branch of Neuro based in Sofia, Bulgaria.

**Client:** Neuro Europe – Official EU Distributor of Neuro Functional Gum & Mints (getneuro.eu)

**Timeline:** 6-Month Campaign

**Objective:** To successfully launch the Neuro brand in key European markets, drive initial e-commerce sales, rapidly build brand awareness, and grow Neuro Europe's social media presence through targeted influencer / creator collaborations.

### The Challenge: Entering a New Market & Building Trust from Scratch

Neuro Europe faced the typical hurdles of a new market entrant: low brand recognition, the need to educate consumers about a novel functional product, and the challenge of building trust and driving sales without an established customer base in Europe. They needed a strategy that could quickly generate buzz, social proof, and direct e-commerce traffic, at a more affordable cost than running social media campaigns.

After we got in touch with the CMO of the European branch, Filip, we crafted a strategy that would:

*   Increase revenue, build social proof, and spart a wave of UGC content and brand awareness


### Our Solution: A Scaled, Data-Driven Influencer / Creator Outreach Campaign

1SecondLeads designed a multi-layered influencer marketing strategy focused on engaging relevant micro and macro-influencers across key European countries. The goal was to leverage their authentic voices to introduce Neuro products to highly targeted audiences.

**Phase 1: Defining the Ideal Influencer Profile (IIP) & Strategic Targeting**

We identified distinct influencer tiers and niches best suited to promote Neuro Europe's functional gum and mints:

*   **IIP 1: Micro-Influencers & Blog Owners (for Affiliate Program Onboarding)**
    *   **Niches:**
        *   Productivity & Biohacking (e.g., "studygram," "productibity hacks," "dopamine detox," "l-theanine")
        *   Health & Wellness (e.g., "clean diet," "natural supplements," "mindfulness")
        *   Fitness & Active Lifestyle (e.g., "natural bodybuilder," "yoga," "running," "gym girlie," "fitness mom")
        *   Gaming & Esports (where focus and sustained energy are key)
        *   Student Life & Academics
    *   **Follower/Audience Size:** 15,000 - 50,000 (Instagram, TikTok), or blogs with relevant niche traffic.
    *   **Key Characteristics:** High engagement rates, authentic connection with their audience, content genuinely aligns with Neuro's benefits (energy, focus, clarity, natural ingredients).
    *   **Geographic Focus:** Germany, Austria, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Nordics (initial EU launch countries).

*   **IIP 2: Mid-Tier to Macro Influencers (for Paid Promotions + Affiliate Offer)**
    *   **Niches:** Similar to above, but with a broader reach and more established presence.
    *   **Follower/Audience Size:** 50,000 - 500,000+
    *   **Key Characteristics:** Professional content, history of successful brand collaborations (ideally in CPG, wellness, or lifestyle), strong trust factor, significant reach within target European demographics.

**Targeting Tools & Initial Sourcing:**

*   **Primary Tool - Clay.com + Influencers.club Integration:** Used to systematically search for influencers based on keywords in their bio or hashtags they used in their recent posts (e.g., "productivity," "vegan supplements," etc.), niches, follower counts, and platform (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube). Influencers.club is key for finding direct contact information.
*   **Secondary (for Blogs/Media Outlets) - Apollo.io + Semrush:** To identify specific blog *owners* and established personalities.
*   **Manual Exploration (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Search):** To initially identify trending content styles and key opinion leaders to refine automated search parameters.

**Phase 2: Deep Enrichment & Contact Validation with Clay.com**

Raw lists of potential influencers were processed through Clay for deep enrichment to ensure fit and personalize outreach:

1.  **Consolidate Data from Influencers.club:** Pull in email addresses, social profile links, follower counts, and any available engagement metrics.
2.  **Scrape Social Media Profiles (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube via Clay's browser):**
    *   **Purpose:** Verify profile authenticity, assess content quality and relevance, understand audience interaction.
    *   **Data Points Used:** Bio description (looking for keywords like "health," "focus," "student," "gamer"), recent post themes/captions, visual style, comment sentiment (qualitative), actual follower count.
    *   **Signal for Neuro Europe (Reason to Collaborate):**
        *   "This influencer consistently posts about **natural ways to boost productivity and maintain focus during study/work**, making Neuro's benefits a perfect thematic fit for their audience who actively seeks such solutions."
        *   "Their audience shows **high engagement on posts related to healthy lifestyle choices and clean supplements**; Neuro's sugar-free, vegan, and natural formulation will resonate strongly."
        *   "The influencer has a **clear European audience base (evident from comments, language, or bio location)**, ensuring promotions reach Neuro Europe's target market directly."
        *   "Recent content includes **reviews or recommendations of similar (but not directly competitive) wellness or energy products**, indicating their audience is receptive to this category and trusts their judgment."
3.  **For Blog Owners - Scrape Blog "About Us," "Contact," & Recent Posts:**
    *   **Purpose:** Understand blog niche, readership, and if they accept product reviews/sponsored content.
    *   **Signal for Neuro Europe (Reason to Collaborate):**
        *   "This blog regularly features **articles on 'improving focus or productivity** providing an ideal editorial context for introducing Neuro gum/mints as a solution."
        *   "The blog has a dedicated **'product reviews' section or 'work with us' page clearly stating openness to brand partnerships** in the wellness or lifestyle space, indicating a good potential for collaboration."
4.  **AI Content Analysis (OpenAI in Clay):**
    *   **Purpose:** Further qualify influencers and generate personalization angles.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Analyze recent post captions/blog article snippets for alignment with Neuro's core message (energy, clarity, focus).
        *   Identify if an influencer has previously promoted direct competitors (to avoid conflict or tailor pitch).
        *   Draft personalized opening lines for outreach based on their specific content. E.g., *"Loved your recent post on [topic related to focus/energy]; Neuro could be a great addition for your audience seeking that extra mental edge."*
5.  **Verify Contact Information:** Ensure email deliverability.

**Phase 3: Multi-Tiered Outreach Campaign Execution**

We crafted distinct outreach sequences for different influencer segments, managed through an email sending platform (like Instantly.ai, fed by Clay).

**Outreach Stream 1: Micro-Influencers & Bloggers (Affiliate Program Focus)**

*   **Offer:** Free product samples, unique affiliate tracking link, competitive commission on sales (15-20%).
