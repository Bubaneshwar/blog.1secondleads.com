Acceros helps eComm & SaaS brands turn websites into growth machines. Better UX, faster speed, and expert-level CRO.

But their own growth was stalled.

They were stuck in the manual outbound trap — spending full days just to book a handful of calls. Then they got burned by a low-performing agency that killed their trust in outsourced lead gen.

That’s when they partnered with us at 1SecondLeads.

We didn’t just book meetings.  
We installed a 3-phase outbound system that used hyper-specific data to book qualified buyers who actually showed up.

## 🔍 **Phase 1 – Intent-Based Prospecting**

We skipped the generic filters. Acceros needed clients with a specific kind of pain, so we targeted companies already signaling they needed help.

We built lists based on **growth-blocking behaviors**, like:

- **Using CRO/analytics tech** (Hotjar, Mixpanel, CrazyEgg) but still having high bounce rates
- **High monthly traffic** (via SEMrush) but a low-converting tech stack (e.g., slow Shopify theme)
- **Running paid ads** to a site with poor PageSpeed scores (literally burning money)
- **eCommerce stores** with clunky UX and abandoned cart issues

We didn’t look for companies that "needed a website."  
_We looked for companies actively losing money because of their website._

## 🧠 **Phase 2 – Research-Per-Unit™ Enrichment**

This is where we turned a cold list into a can’t-ignore offer.

Instead of guessing, our **Research-Per-Unit™ system** ran each lead through an enrichment waterfall to find the one thing that would make them reply.

Each company was enriched with:

- **Website scraping** → identified their *actual* service packages and pricing
- **Tech stack analysis** → flagged tools that proved they cared about CRO
- **Performance scores** → pinpointed specific speed and UX bottlenecks
- **GPT prompts** → auto-generated a hyper-personalized hook based on their *own* offers

Then came the message that booked Acceros:

> “If I brought you 15 more clients for this [Specific eComm Package] offer — would it be worth a quick chat?”

We didn’t pitch “lead gen.”  
We pitched **their own offer back to them**, scaled.

## 📞 **Phase 3 – The Pre-Call Conversion Engine**

Most agencies book the meeting and disappear. We do the opposite.

The moment a meeting was booked, our job wasn't over. We immediately started warming them up for the sale.

Every lead received a confirmation call the day before their meeting.

Not to sell. To prepare:

> “Hey [Prospect], Kristijan is looking forward to chatting tomorrow about fixing [their specific CRO issue]. Just wanted to quickly confirm and see if you had any initial questions we could prep for him.”

This simple step gave Acceros:

- **Book-to-meeting rate of 84%**
- **No-show rate under 3%**
- Prospects arrived warmed up, pre-qualified, and ready to talk solutions.

---

## 🚀 **Results (First 4 Months)**

While Acceros was initially skeptical of agencies, these are the numbers we delivered in the first four months of our partnership:

- **38 meetings booked**
- **32 meetings showed up** (at an 84% show-up rate)
- **19 went to proposal**
- **5 deals closed**
- **3 more in the pipeline**

All from a cold channel they thought was dead.  
No ads. No referrals. Just outbound that understands the buyer.
